Subject: [PATCH 4/5] finished: don't run eos-diagnostics

This has to be installed separately from eos-installer, and we don't
currently do that for the Spectrum installer.  If there was an error,
eos-installer would try to run it, and then display an additional
error message about not being able to find it on the error screen.
