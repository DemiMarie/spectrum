# This file contains the services that need to be started even
# if nothing else depends on them.  It should not include services
# that are only needed by other services.  For instance, it would
# not be appropriate for this file to reference systemd-udevd.
# However, services should be included in this file whenever they
# are directly needed by the user, even if they depend on another
# service in this files.  For instance, sys-vmms depends on weston,
# but it is still included.

# VMMs that should be started at boot.  In the future
# it might make sense to start them only as needed.
sys-vmms

# The Wayland compositor.
weston
