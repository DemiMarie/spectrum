The https://spectrum-os.org/git/spectrum/tree/release.nix[release.nix]
file contains everything considered to be part of a "full build" of
Spectrum.  That is, building release.nix should build everything we'd
like to make sure builds successfully, and everything we'd like to be
available in the binary cache.  This includes the various Spectrum
images for distribution, as well as the xref:checks.adoc[checks].
