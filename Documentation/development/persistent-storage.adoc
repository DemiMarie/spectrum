Spectrum's root filesystem is immutable, so if you want to be able to
persist data between sessions, you'll need to create a persistent
storage partition.  Spectrum comes with command line tools for working
with ext4.

Conventionally, the persistent storage partition is mounted on /ext
after booting.  It's not mounted automatically, because generally the
partition should be encrypted, meaning a key has to be supplied to
mount it anyway, and because there might be multiple persistent data
partitions to choose from.
