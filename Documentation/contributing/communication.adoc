There are several places online in which announcements,
discussion, and collaboration happen. Rather than tell
you about them all at once, though, it is best to tell you
which ones are relevant to you, given how you would like
to participate (or not) in the project.

Our primary methods of communication are Matrix and mailing lists.

[#chat]
== Matrix Chat

There is a single Matrix chat room,
https://matrix.to/#/#spectrum:fairydust.space[#spectrum:fairydust.space],
for all kinds of Spectrum discussion.

You can also join through IRC â€”
link:ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/spectrum[#spectrum] on
https://libera.chat/[Libera.Chat].


== Mailing Lists

If you are interested in participating in the project, or even just
following along with it, the best thing to do is subscribe to one or
more of the Spectrum mailing lists.

Each list has https://spectrum-os.org/lists/archives/[archives] that
can also be accessed via the web, NNTP or Atom. If you have the
capacity to mirror them, please do!

[#spectrum-announce]
=== announce@spectrum-os.org

This is a one-way list where announcements from Spectrum's developers
will be posted.

[#spectrum-discuss]
=== discuss@spectrum-os.org

[#spectrum-devel]
