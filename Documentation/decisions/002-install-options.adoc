## Status
Proposed

## Context
Based on identified different audiences for the Spectrum OS release it is
proposed we support three base configurations to use with Spectrum OS in the
first boot.

## Decision
* Minimal - Spectrum OS host + system VMs: netvm, guivm, usbvm + home-directory
  encrypted (see 004-disk-encryption.md)
* Common - Minimal + browser app VM + 2-3 selected app VMs
* Power - Common + NixOS VM

## Consequences
Requires first-boot-vm (like wizard) to support user to get started.
