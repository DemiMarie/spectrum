## Status
Proposed

## Context
To support user data and privacy protection, encryption of data at rest is
required.

## Decision
User data is encrypted.

## Consequences
Spectrum OS needs to come with enough SW to get the encryption key via different
methods (password, usb, fido, etc.) Can we use dm-crypt for everything instead
of LUKS?
