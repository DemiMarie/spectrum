### Status
Proposed

### Context
Guest VM software needs to communicate with software in other guest VMs

### Decision
Spectrum provides two mechanism
- TCP/IP with virtio-net
- Wayland with virtio-gpu (nevermind the semantics) for streamed IPC protocol to
  send references to shared memory


### Consequences
- Examples required on how to write applications which communicate over
  virtio-gpu
