## Status
Accepted

## Context
To harden the trusted computing base and make it more minimal, the target is to
minimize the amount of drivers on the Spectrum host kernel.

## Decision
We are aiming to have as few drivers as possible on the host.

## Consequences
No networking on the host. Responsibilities of the host are expected to get
smaller over time. More flexible management of devices. We need to decouple
device classes - like net, usb, bluetooth and gui - from host to their
respective VMs.
