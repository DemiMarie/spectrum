## Status
Proposed

## Context
To support specific USB devices on specific VMs

## Decision
The decision is to pass-through USB controller to a VM with authorization
controls inside the VMs to forward a specific USB device using USBIP.

## Consequences
We need to modify the upstream USBIP daemon to support authorization.
