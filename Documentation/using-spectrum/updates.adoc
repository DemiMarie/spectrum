Spectrum supports updates via the `update` command.  This
takes the path to a staging directory as argument.  `update`
will create the directory, use it for the update, and then
delete it.  The parent directory must exist and be on a BTRFS
filesystem.

Updates are atomic and take effect after the system reboots.
If the system is rebooted, crashes, or loses power during an
update, the update will automatically be rolled back.  Updates
are digitally signed and Spectrum will refuse to install an
update that does not have a trusted signature.

See xref:../documentation/build-configuration.adoc[build configuration]
for what is needed for updates to work.
