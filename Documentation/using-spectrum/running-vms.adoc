== Basic VM commands

Running VMs can be managed with the following commands, available in a
host terminal:

`lsvm`:: List available VMs, along with whether they are currently running.
`vm-console <name>`:: Open a terminal emulator for a VM's console.
`vm-start <name>`:: Start a VM.
`vm-stop <name>`:: Stop a VM.

== Transient VMs for AppImages

Double click a .AppImage file in the file manager to run that
application in a transient VM.  The VM will be destroyed when the
application exits.

TIP: Like on other systems, running AppImages requires them to have
the executable bit set.  This is not currently possible to do with the
file manager in Spectrum, but can be done with `chmod +x` in the
terminal.
