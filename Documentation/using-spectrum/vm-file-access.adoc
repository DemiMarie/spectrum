Spectrum VMs start without any access to user data, but the user can
grant VMs access to files while the VM is running.

== File chooser portal

Some applications implement the
https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/[XDG Desktop Portal]
https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser.html[File
Chooser API].  If you're using an application that does, when you
choose to open or save a file in the application, you'll see a file
chooser dialog that allows you to choose a single location to open or
save to.  The host will then share this single location with the VM.

TIP: Some applications will only try to use portals when they detect
that they're running in a sandbox, and they won't realize that a
Spectrum VMs is a sandbox.  There might be ways to force them to use
portals anyway, for example by setting the environment variable
`GTK_USE_PORTAL` to `1` for GTK 3, or
https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/running.html#gdk_debug[`GDK_DEBUG`] to
`portals` for GTK 4.

TIP: Downloads to a fixed directory will not use the portal, and so
will not be visible outside the VM.  For example, a normal download in
Firefox will just download the "Downloads" directory on the transient
VM filesystem, but downloading a file using "Save Link Asâ€¦" will use
the portal.

== Manually sharing files with a VM

When using an application that doesn't implement the File Chooser API,
you can still give it access to files manually.  Each VM has
xref:creating-custom-vms.adoc#filesystem[access] to the
/run/vm/_name_/fs directory on the host (mounted at
/run/virtiofs/virtiofs0 in the default Spectrum VM image).  For the
VM, this directory is read-only, but writeable files and directories
can be bind-mounted into it:

[example]
====
1. Create a file to share with the VM:
+
[listing]
[source,shell]
echo "Hello, world!" > /ext/example.txt

2. Create an empty file to bind mount over:
+
[listing]
[source,shell]
touch /run/vm/user.appvm-example/fs/example.txt

3. Create the bind mount:
+
[listing]
[source,shell]
mount --rbind /ext/example.txt /run/vm/user.appvm-example/fs/example.txt
